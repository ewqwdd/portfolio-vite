The trickiest part was creating a chessboard and making drag-and-drop smooth for users. I also tried to optimize the project as much as possible with async components. Overall, it was good practice.",

Looking back, I see I made some less-than-perfect decisions, but it was a learning experience. I've taken those lessons to heart and now avoid those mistakes in my current work.",
